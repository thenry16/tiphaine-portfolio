          <p>
            Bäm is a brand and registered trademark by Dr. Johannes Jacubeit,
            under which he has bundled and marketed various smaller projects and
            (mostly climbing) products in the past. The common denominator is
            the motto &quot;Bäm - make things happen.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            Bäm - Afterclimb is a soothing gel for the hands, which provides for
            a faster healing of the skin after sports climbing. I have provided
            packaging, CI and web designs for it.
